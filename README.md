# Climate-Visibility
Project Overview: This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing climate data to understand patterns in visibility, temperature, humidity, and other weather parameters. Using Python, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate meaningful visualizations to uncover trends and correlations in climate data.
